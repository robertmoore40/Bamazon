# Bamazon
Homework-12


Bamazon is an Amazon like app which connects to mysql and uses different inquirer choices in order to perform different functions on those databases.

bamazonCustomer allows you to view the current product database, and then asks if the user would like to buy a product. The user then can input an id and quantity. If the id and quantity are both real, positive integers, and there is sufficient quantity, the amount purchased will be reduced from the stock quantity.

bamazonManager allows you to choose several different functions which are chosen from inquirer. The user can view all inventory, view low inventory, restock items, and add new items.
